In my SBA I create a server and a Restful API using express.js. My project includes http rout like GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE. My theme for this project is a dream interpretation. The three data categories I have are  users, dream submissions, and dream meanings.You can should different data by filtering by their id. I also create a form which if the user sign up it send the login information to the server.
